called “stressors”.&nbsp; Your body and brain go into “alert” mode when responding to stressors.&nbsp; You naturally react to a danger threat, whether the threat is real or not.&nbsp; You react by physically and mentally preparing to fight or run (take flight) from the threat.&nbsp; This reaction is known as “fight or flight”.<br><br><strong>1.2 Effects of Stress on Performance</strong></p><p>While deployed, you had to stay “on guard” most of the time.&nbsp; Your safety, your life, and the lives of others depended on it.&nbsp; Returning from deployment, you may continue to feel “amped-up” or think you need to stay “on guard” to be safe.<br><br>The increased stress that helps you respond to threats during deployment can prevent you from coping with stressors in daily life.&nbsp; When your body is under too much stress, you’re more likely to:</p><ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Miss important details</li><li>Misinterpret situations</li><li>Perform poorly

Triggers may also remind you of stressful events from your life before the military.

Changing the way you think can change the way you feel.<br><br><strong>Mental Reframing</strong></p>\n<p>The way people think about things affects their reactions to stress.&nbsp; After a deployment, you may believe the world is a more dangerous place or constantly worry that harm could come to you or your loved ones.&nbsp; Or you may feel you have less control over your life.&nbsp; These thoughts may cause you to look at situations and events differently than before you were deployed.&nbsp; It’s normal to think differently about your environment after a deployment.</p>\n<p>Everyone has a constant stream of thoughts running through their minds—this is called <strong>self-talk</strong>.&nbsp; Self-talk reflects your beliefs and attitudes about the world, other people, and yourself.&nbsp; It’s important to examine your thoughts and beliefs carefully challenge those thoughts that are not realistic of helpful.</p>\n<p>Mental reframing is a process you can learn to interrupt self-talk and challenge negative thoughts with more realistic, positive thoughts.&nbsp; There are 5 steps involved in mental reframing:</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Self-monitoring</strong></p>\n<p>Your first step in mental reframing is to monitor your thoughts (self-talk).&nbsp; Your awareness of self-talk in stressful situations will help you to prepare to <strong><em>think</em></strong> differently.</p>\n<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td height="58">\n<table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;(<strong>A</strong>)ctivating event <strong>+</strong> (<strong>B</strong>)eliefs&nbsp; <strong>= </strong>(<strong>C</strong>)onsequences)</p>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr></tbody></table></td>\n</tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Step 2: The ABC Method</strong></p>\n<p>The second step in mental reframing is to identify those thoughts that cause feelings and motivate your behavior.&nbsp; In most situations, people do not automatically respond to events.&nbsp; People usually think about an event, about their ability to manage the situation, and <em>then</em> they respond.&nbsp; Often your thoughts or interpretation of a stressful event leads to a stress reaction.&nbsp; The “ABC” method is a good way to think of the relationship between thoughts and behaviors:</p>\n<ol style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>An <u><strong>A</strong></u>ctivating event is a stressful situation or event</li>\n<li>The event triggers thought or <u><strong>B</strong></u>eliefs</li>\n<li>As a <u><strong>C</strong></u>onsequence your beliefs about the event change your stress level</li>\n</ol><p><br>Here is an example of the ABC model:</p>\n<ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li><u>A</u><u>ctivating event</u>: While on leave, you hop on a bus to visit family. The bus gets stuck in traffic because of road construction.</li>\n<li><u>Beliefs</u>: As you take in the situation, you begin to form beliefs about the event. Your beliefs determine whether you see this as a minor inconvenience or a major problem.</li>\n<li><u>Consequences</u>: The consequence of your beliefs is that you feel stressed OR relaxed for the rest of the ride, depending on what your beliefs tell you.</li>\n</ul><p><br><u>Negative Beliefs about the event</u></p>\n<ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>This will take forever.&nbsp; I’ll never get home.</li>\n<li>Why does this always happen to me?</li>\n<li>They always do construction at the worst times.</li>\n</ul><p><u>Positive Beliefs about the event</u></p>\n<ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>I’ll just be a few minutes late.</li>\n<li>I’m going to listen to some music while I wait.</li>\n<li>I’m glad they are fixing the road</li>\n</ul><p><br><u>Step 3: Negative Thought Patterns</u></p>\n<p>The third step in mental reframing is to recognize when your beliefs about an event or situation are unhelpful or negative.&nbsp; The following are examples of negative thought patterns that can increase stress levels:</p>\n<ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li><u>All or Nothing</u>: You tend to experience things in black and white terms.&nbsp; You see situations as either entirely “<em>good</em>” or “<em>bad</em>”, when there is clearly a middle ground.&nbsp; An example of all-or-nothing thinking is that <strong><em>either</em></strong> you are perfect <strong><em>or </em></strong>you’re a failure.</li>\n<li><u>Exaggeration</u>: Sometimes exaggeration is also called “catastrophizing”.&nbsp; This thinking pattern involves blowing the imagined consequences of an event out of proportion.&nbsp; You may see minor problems as being “horrible” or “disastrous”.&nbsp; Others may say “you’re making a mountain out of a molehill”.&nbsp; Sometimes it is hard to pinpoint your trigger.&nbsp; If you can’t identify it, don’t worry.&nbsp; Work on relaxing and calming yourself.</li>\n<li><u>Overgeneralization</u>: &nbsp;You take an isolated experience or piece of information and draw the wrong conclusions.&nbsp; You see isolated negative events as a never-ending pattern of negative events or defeat.&nbsp; For example, if someone turns you down for a date, you conclude that you are <em>always</em> rejected or that you will <em>never</em> find the right person.&nbsp; Look for words such as <strong>always</strong> or <strong>never </strong>in your self-talk as signs that you are over generalizing.</li>\n<li><u>Mind-reading</u>: You assume you know what another person is thinking, even though you have no evidence to back up your assumptions.&nbsp; When you mind-read, you almost always assume that someone is thinking the worst about you.&nbsp; For example, you might think your friends don’t want to hear about your deployment experiences.&nbsp; In reality, your friends want to know what happened but feel awkward asking you questions.&nbsp; Look for phrases like <strong>he/ she probably thinks</strong>...or <strong>they don’t understand</strong>… in your self-talk as signs that you are mind-reading.</li>\n</ul><p><br><u>Step 4: Challenging Your Thoughts</u></p>\n<p>The fourth step in mental reframing is to challenge your negative thinking patterns and self-talk.&nbsp; This takes a lot of practice and patience because self-talk is a reflection of your core beliefs about yourself, others, and the world.</p>\n<p>Look carefully for evidence that challenges negative or stressful self-talk.&nbsp; In order to challenge your negative thinking, you can ask yourself the following questions:</p>\n<ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Is there evidence for or against my stressful thought or belief?</li>\n<li>Am I thinking in all-or-nothing terms?</li>\n<li>Am I using words or phrases such as disastrous, horrible, and awful?</li>\n<li>Am I making sweeping generalizations based on a single event?</li>\n<li>Am I using words like always and never in my self-talk?</li>\n<li>Am I judging what other people think, when I really don’t know what they think?</li>\n<li>Is my information source reliable?</li>\n<li>Are my beliefs based on feelings rather than facts?</li>\n</ul><p><br><u>Step 5: Using Positive Self-talk</u></p>\n<p>The final step in mental reframing is to replace negative, stressful self-talk with positive, empowering self-talk.&nbsp; You may be surprised at how changing your outlook on stressful situations or events can change your life.&nbsp; Every situation presents opportunities to learn and grow.&nbsp; The more you focus on the positive aspects of the situation, the more control you have over your stress reactions.<br><br><strong>3.5 Stress Journal</strong></p>\n<p>Keeping a stress journal helps you realize when you’re having a stress response.&nbsp; The earlier you identify your stress reactions, the sooner you can do something about them.&nbsp; Every time you feel stressed, stop and look closely at your situation.&nbsp; Then enter the following information into your stress journal.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Where was I?</li>\n<li>What was going on around me?</li>\n<li>Who was I with?</li>\n<li>How could I have used more positive thinking and realistic self-talk to handle stress?</li>\n<li>Could I identify a negative thinking pattern? All-or-nothing thinking</li>\n<li>Exaggeration (catastrophizing)</li>\n<li>Overgeneralization</li>\n<li>Mind-reading</li>\n<li>What was I doing?</li>\n<li>What was I thinking?</li>\n<li>What was I saying to myself (self-talk)?</li>\n<li>What signs of stress was I having (physical, psychological, emotional)?</li>\n<li>On a scale of 0-10, how stressful was this situation?&nbsp; (Zero being as calm and relaxed as possible.&nbsp; Ten being severe stress and panic.</li>\n</ul><p><br><strong>3.6 Emotion-focused Strategies for Coping with Stress</strong></p>\n<p>Often we simply try to cope with stress without realizing we can change the situations and conditions that cause the stress.&nbsp; We <strong>DO</strong> have some control over the causes of stress in our lives.</p>\n<p><em><u>Some stressors can be eliminated or diminished easily. </u></em></p>\n<p><u>Example</u>: Milo has had a nagging toothache for a few weeks that is contributing to his stress and irritability.&nbsp;

The <em>most </em>important step in problem-solving is committing to it!&nbsp; If you have the mindset that “I need to fix this” or “I need to do something different“ you will likely find a solution.&nbsp; Problem-solving is a skill you can learn through practice.</p>\n<ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li><strong>STEP 1: </strong>Recognize the Signals of Stress</li>\n<li><strong>STEP 2: </strong>Define the Problem</li>\n<li><strong>STEP 3: </strong>Set a Goal</li>\n<li><strong>STEP 4: </strong>Brainstorm Possible Solutions</li>\n<li><strong>STEP 5: &nbsp;</strong>Evaluate Possible Solutions</li>\n<li><strong>STEP 6: &nbsp;</strong>Choose the Best Solution Based on Pros and Cons</li>\n<li><strong>STEP 7: &nbsp;</strong>Make a Plan and Try Your Solution</li>\n<li><strong>STEP 8: </strong>&nbsp;Assess the Solution’s Progress</li>\n<li><strong>STEP 9: </strong>&nbsp;If the First Solution Didn’t Work, Try Another!</li>\n</ul><p>Let’s take a closer look at each step and how you can practice problem-solving strategies for coping with stress.</p>\n<p><strong>STEP 1:</strong> Recognize the Signals of Stress</p>\n<p>Learn to watch for signs and situations that often cause stress.</p>\n<p><u>Example</u>: &nbsp;<em>Max has recently returned from Iraq.&nbsp; He couldn’t wait to go home to his wife and son,&nbsp;but now that he is home, he feels anxious and irritable every night as he drives home from base.</em></p>\n<p><strong>STEP 2: </strong>Define the Problem</p>\n<p>Find the real problem and be specific about how it triggers your stress reaction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max asks himself: “What is it about going home that makes me feel stressed?”&nbsp; He realizes his stress is related to his son’s poor performance at school and bad attitude at home.</em></p>\n<p><strong>STEP 3: </strong>Set a Goal</p>\n<p>Try to set a goal for how to respond in a way that reduces stress.</p>\n<p><em>Max knows he can’t control how other people act and that he can’t turn Max Jr. into a “perfect” son. But, as a father, Max does have some influence over his son.&nbsp; He decides to set specific, manageable goals, such as getting Max Jr. to spend more time on homework and help more around the house. Wait to go home to his wife and son, but now that he is home, he feels anxious and irritable every night as he drives home from base.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>STEP 4: </strong>Brainstorm Possible Solutions</p>\n<p>Get creative about possible solutions. When you brainstorm, don’t judge any of the solutions, just let them flow. Even if some ideas seem ridiculous, write them down. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max starts brainstorming the following solutions without judging them. </em><em>For instance,</em> g<em>round Max Jr. until he changes his attitude and does his homework; send Max Jr. to live with his grandmother; spend more quality time with Max Jr. and talk to him about problem solving; get a tutor for Max Jr.</em></p>\n<p><strong>STEP 5: &nbsp;</strong>Evaluate Possible Solutions</p>\n<p>Review the list of possible solutions and evaluate how well they may address the problem.</p>\n<p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max makes a list of the pros and cons of each possible solution.</em></p>\n<p><strong>STEP 6: &nbsp;</strong>Choose the Best Solution Based on Pros and Cons</p>\n<p>Problem-solving experts suggest giving special considerations to the solution with the least cons. You may want to pick a second solution in case the first one does not work.</p>\n<p><u>Example</u>: &nbsp;<em>Max studies his list of pros and cons for each possible solution.&nbsp; He finds that the solution with the most pros and fewest cons is to spend more quality time with his son.&nbsp; His back-up solution is to hire a tutor to help Max Jr. with his homework.</em></p>\n<p><strong>STEP 7: &nbsp;</strong>Make a Plan and Try Your Solution</p>\n<p>Now create a specific plan to carry out your solution. You may need to divide the plan into steps.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max has decided on a possible solution and forms a plan.&nbsp; He will sit down with Max Jr. this weekend to make a list of the boy’s favorite things to do.&nbsp; Then they will create a plan for Max Jr. to earn some privileges by spending more time on homework and helping around the house.&nbsp; Max will also make himself available in the evenings to help his son with homework.</em></p>\n<p><strong>STEP 8: </strong>&nbsp;Assess the Solution’s Progress</p>\n<p>Reevaluate the situation and see how the actions have changed things.</p>\n<p><u>Example</u>: <em>A month later, Max evaluates his solution by contacting Max Jr’s teachers and learns his son is improving in his schoolwork.&nbsp; He also sees that Max Jr. volunteers for more chores around the house.&nbsp; Max decides that he has met the goal he set for solving his problem.</em></p>\n<p><strong>STEP 9: </strong>&nbsp;If the First Solution Didn’t Work, Try Another!</p>\n<p>If your solution worked, your stress should diminish.&nbsp; If it didn’t work, try another solution from Step 5 until you find one that works.</p>\n<p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max feels much less irritable and stressed now.&nbsp; In fact, he looks forward to coming home from work.&nbsp; He also knows if his first solution didn’t work, he could have tried his second solution of hiring a tutor</em></p>\n</div></div>\n');s.pages.push(i),s.pages.push(r),s.pages.push(l),s.pages.push(a),t.default=s}});
