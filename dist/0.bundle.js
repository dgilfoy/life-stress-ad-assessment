external or internal signals.&nbsp; These internal or external “signals” that promote stress are called “stressors”.&nbsp; Your body and brain go into “alert” mode when responding to stressors.&nbsp; You naturally react to a danger threat, whether the threat is real or not.&nbsp; You react by physically and mentally preparing to fight or run (take flight) from the threat.&nbsp; This reaction is known as “fight or flight”.<br><br><strong>1.2 Effects of Stress on Performance</strong></p><p>While deployed, you had to stay “on guard” most of the time.&nbsp; Your safety, your life, and the lives of others depended on it.&nbsp; Returning from deployment, you may continue to feel “amped-up” or think you need to stay “on guard” to be safe.<br><br>The increased stress that helps you respond to threats during deployment can prevent you from coping with stressors in daily life.&nbsp; When your body is under too much stress, you’re more likely to:</p><ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Miss important details</li><li>Misinterpret situations</li><li>Perform poorly on everyday tasks</li></ul><p><br>Knowing when you are under too much stress can help you avoid serious physical effect of

The bus gets stuck in traffic because of road construction.</li>\n        <li><u>Beliefs</u>: As you take in the situation, you begin to form beliefs about the event. Your beliefs determine whether you see this as a minor inconvenience or a major problem.</li>\n        <li><u>Consequences</u>: The consequence of your beliefs is that you feel stressed OR relaxed for the rest of the ride, depending on what your beliefs tell you.</li>\n        </ul><p><br><u>Negative Beliefs about the event</u></p>\n        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>This will take forever.&nbsp; I’ll never get home.</li>\n        <li>Why does this always happen to me?</li>\n        <li>They always do construction at the worst times.</li>\n        </ul><p><u>Positive Beliefs about the event</u></p>\n        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>I’ll just be a few minutes late.</li>\n        <li>I’m going to listen to some music while I wait.</li>\n        <li>I’m glad they are fixing the road</li>\n        </ul><p><br><u>Step 3: Negative Thought Patterns</u></p>\n        <p>The third step in mental reframing is to recognize when your beliefs about an event or situation are unhelpful or negative.&nbsp; The following are examples of negative thought patterns that can increase stress levels:</p>\n        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li><u>All or Nothing</u>: You tend to experience things in black and white terms.&nbsp; You see situations as either entirely “<em>good</em>” or “<em>bad</em>”, when there is clearly a middle ground.&nbsp; An example of all-or-nothing thinking is that <strong><em>either</em></strong> you are perfect <strong><em>or </em></strong>you’re a failure.</li>\n        <li><u>Exaggeration</u>: Sometimes exaggeration is also called “catastrophizing”.&nbsp; This thinking pattern involves blowing the imagined consequences of an event out of proportion.&nbsp; You may see minor problems as being “horrible” or “disastrous”.&nbsp; Others may say “you’re making a mountain out of a molehill”.&nbsp; Sometimes it is hard to pinpoint your trigger.&nbsp; If you can’t identify it, don’t worry.&nbsp; Work on relaxing and calming yourself.</li>\n        <li><u>Overgeneralization</u>: &nbsp;You take an isolated experience or piece of information and draw the wrong conclusions.&nbsp; You see isolated negative events as a never-ending pattern of negative events or defeat.&nbsp; For example, if someone turns you down for a date, you conclude that you are <em>always</em> rejected or that you will <em>never</em> find the right person.&nbsp; Look for words such as <strong>always</strong> or <strong>never </strong>in your self-talk as signs that you are over generalizing.</li>\n        <li><u>Mind-reading</u>: You assume you know what another person is thinking, even though you have no evidence to back up your assumptions.&nbsp; When you mind-read, you almost always assume that someone is thinking the worst about you.&nbsp; For example, you might think your friends don’t want to hear about your deployment experiences.&nbsp; In reality, your friends want to know what happened but feel awkward asking you questions.&nbsp; Look for phrases like <strong>he/ she probably thinks</strong>...or <strong>they don’t understand</strong>… in your self-talk as signs that you are mind-reading.</li>\n        </ul><p><br><u>Step 4: Challenging Your Thoughts</u></p>\n        <p>The fourth step in mental reframing is to challenge your negative thinking patterns and self-talk.&nbsp; This takes a lot of practice and patience because self-talk is a reflection of your core beliefs about yourself, others, and the world.</p>\n        <p>Look carefully for evidence that challenges negative or stressful self-talk.&nbsp; In order to challenge your negative thinking, you can ask yourself the following questions:</p>\n        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Is there evidence for or against my stressful thought or belief?</li>\n        <li>Am I thinking in all-or-nothing terms?</li>\n        <li>Am I using words or phrases such as disastrous, horrible, and awful?</li>\n        <li>Am I making sweeping generalizations based on a single event?</li>\n        <li>Am I using words like always and never in my self-talk?</li>\n        <li>Am I judging what other people think, when I really don’t know what they think?</li>\n        <li>Is my information source reliable?</li>\n        <li>Are my beliefs based on feelings rather than facts?</li>\n        </ul><p><br><u>Step 5: Using Positive Self-talk</u></p>\n        <p>The final step in mental reframing is to replace negative, stressful self-talk with positive, empowering self-talk.&nbsp; You may be surprised at how changing your outlook on stressful situations or events can change your life.&nbsp; Every situation presents opportunities to learn and grow.&nbsp; The more you focus on the positive aspects of the situation, the more control you have over your stress reactions.<br><br><strong>3.5 Stress Journal</strong></p>\n        <p>Keeping a stress journal helps you realize when you’re having a stress response.&nbsp; The earlier you identify your stress reactions, the sooner you can do something about them.&nbsp; Every time you feel stressed, stop and look closely at your situation.&nbsp; Then enter the following information into your stress journal.&nbsp;</p>\n        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Where was I?</li>\n        <li>What was going on around me?</li>\n        <li>Who was I with?</li>\n        <li>How could I have used more positive thinking and realistic self-talk to handle stress?</li>\n        <li>Could I identify a negative thinking pattern?

He couldn’t wait to go home to his wife and son,&nbsp;but now that he is home, he feels anxious and irritable every night as he drives home from base.</em></p>\n        <p><strong>STEP 2: </strong>Define the Problem</p>\n        <p>Find the real problem and be specific about how it triggers your stress reaction.&nbsp;</p>\n        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max asks himself: “What is it about going home that makes me feel stressed?”&nbsp; He realizes his stress is related to his son’s poor performance at school and bad attitude at home.</em></p>\n        <p><strong>STEP 3: </strong>Set a Goal</p>\n        <p>Try to set a goal for how to respond in a way that reduces stress.</p>\n        <p><em>Max knows he can’t control how other people act and that he can’t turn Max Jr. into a “perfect” son. But, as a father, Max does have some influence over his son.&nbsp; He decides to set specific, manageable goals, such as getting Max Jr. to spend more time on homework and help more around the house. Wait to go home to his wife and son, but now that he is home, he feels anxious and irritable every night as he drives home from base.</em></p>\n        <p>&nbsp;<strong>STEP 4: </strong>Brainstorm Possible Solutions</p>\n        <p>Get creative about possible solutions. When you brainstorm, don’t judge any of the solutions, just let them flow. Even if some ideas seem ridiculous, write them down. &nbsp;</p>\n        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max starts brainstorming the following solutions without judging them. </em><em>For instance,</em> g<em>round Max Jr. until he changes his attitude and does his homework; send Max Jr. to live with his grandmother; spend more quality time with Max Jr. and talk to him about problem solving; get a tutor for Max Jr.</em></p>\n        <p><strong>STEP 5: &nbsp;</strong>Evaluate Possible Solutions</p>\n        <p>Review the list of possible solutions and evaluate how well they may address the problem.</p>\n        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max makes a list of the pros and cons of each possible solution.</em></p>\n        <p><strong>STEP 6: &nbsp;</strong>Choose the Best Solution Based on Pros and Cons</p>\n        <p>Problem-solving experts suggest giving special considerations to the solution with the least cons. You may want to pick a second solution in case the first one does not work.</p>\n        <p><u>Example</u>: &nbsp;<em>Max studies his list of pros and cons for each possible solution.&nbsp; He finds that the solution with the most pros and fewest cons is to spend more quality time with his son.&nbsp; His back-up solution is to hire a tutor to help Max Jr. with his homework.</em></p>\n        <p><strong>STEP 7: &nbsp;</strong>Make a Plan and Try Your Solution</p>\n        <p>Now create a specific plan to carry out your solution. You may need to divide the plan into steps.&nbsp;</p>\n        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max has decided on a possible solution and forms a plan.&nbsp; He will sit down with Max Jr. this weekend to make a list of the boy’s favorite things to do.&nbsp; Then they will create a plan for Max Jr. to earn some privileges by spending more time on homework and helping around the house.&nbsp; Max will also make himself available in the evenings to help his son with homework.</em></p>\n        <p><strong>STEP 8: </strong>&nbsp;Assess the Solution’s Progress</p>\n        <p>Reevaluate the situation and see how the actions have changed things.</p>\n        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>A month later, Max evaluates his solution by contacting Max Jr’s teachers and learns his son is improving in his schoolwork.&nbsp; He also sees that Max Jr. volunteers for more chores around the house.&nbsp; Max decides that he has met the goal he set for solving his problem.</em></p>\n        <p><strong>STEP 9: </strong>&nbsp;If the First Solution Didn’t Work, Try Another!</p>\n        <p>If your solution worked, your stress should diminish.&nbsp; If it didn’t work, try another solution from Step 5 until you find one that works.</p>\n        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max feels much less irritable and stressed now.&nbsp; In fact, he looks forward to coming home from work.&nbsp; He also knows if his first solution didn’t work, he could have tried his second solution of hiring a tutor</em></p>\n        </div></div>\n        '}]},t.alcoholDrugsLib={id:2,title:"Families and Friendships",content:"When you experience deployment and other challenges in life as a service member or veteran that affect your psychological health, they can affect your relationships with family and friends too.

Here are suggestions for talking about your deployment without going into too much detail:</p>\n        <ul><li>“I saw and did some really intense things that are hard for me to talk about.

It’s important to discuss problems in a way that builds up the relationship instead of tearing it down.  Here are some ideas for handling conflicts with a family member:</p>\n        <ul><li><strong>Plan ahead. </strong> Schedule time to discuss the problem.  This gives both of you time to think about what to say.  Find a time when you can talk without distractions.</li>\n        <li><strong>Identify your goal.  </strong>If your goal is to "win" the argument, your relationship will suffer.  Seek an outcome that will satisfy you both.  This usually requires compromises from both partners.</li>\n        <li><strong>"I" Statements.  </strong>When you bring up an issue, don’t blame the other person.  Blame makes people defensive.  Instead, use “I” statements, telling the other person how you feel.</li>\n        </ul><p >Instead of saying, "you never listen to me," say, "I feel frustrated when you read the newspaper while I’m talking."</p>\n        <p >Instead of saying "That\'s ridiculous!" say, "I don\'t understand what you mean. Can you explain it again?"</p>\n        <ul ><li><strong>Stick to one topic.  </strong>Bring up a specific issue that happened.  Tell the other person exactly what happened and why it bothered you.  Focus on resolving the issue, instead of bringing up other things.  Avoid saying "always” or “never”.</li>\n        </ul><p >Instead of saying "You always nag me!" say, "Sometimes I need a few minutes to unwind after work."</p>\n        <ul ><li><strong>Stay calm: </strong>When you get upset, you\'re less likely to think clearly, and you\'re more likely to say things that don\'t help the situation.  Stay calm, and you\'ll be better able to solve the problem.</li>\n        </ul><p >To stay calm, take breaks during the discussion.  Practice relaxing by counting to 10, breathing slowly, or taking a brief walk to relieve tension.</p>\n        <p >Be sure to tell your partner if you need a short break from the conversation so it doesn\'t seem like you\'re walking away.</p>\n        <ul><li><strong>No "below the belt"</strong> <strong>shots</strong>.  Shouting, name-calling, foul language, threats, and sarcasm usually make arguments worse and make it harder to find common ground.</li>\n        </ul><p> </p>\n        <p><strong>1.6 Approaches That Do “More Harm Than Good”</strong></p>\n        <p>Avoid <strong>criticizing</strong> and <strong>lashing out</strong> in anger during arguments.  Trying to control a conversation by demanding that others respond in a certain way won’t get you good results.  Finally, don’t expect others to solve problems for you<strong>.</strong>  You need to help find the solution.</p>\n        <p> </p>\n        <p><strong>1.7 Your Communication Plan</strong></p>\n        <ul><li>Develop a "Communication Plan" to talk about deployment with your family. </li>\n        <li>Decide ahead of time what you want to discuss.</li>\n        <li>Share a little at a time, and then let the other person respond.</li>\n        <li>Learn to endure painful feelings so you don\'t lash out while sharing.</li>\n        <li>Listen without interrupting or getting defensive.</li>\n        <li>Ask for feedback.</li>\n        <li>Ask the other person to share their own feelings, experiences, and ways of coping.</li>\n        <li>Own up to your feelings and behavior – don\'t blame others for how you feel.</li>\n        </ul>\n      '},{id:2,title:"2.0 - Improving Your Relationships",content:"\n        <p>After challenging and potentially life changing experiences like deployment, you may find that you want to spend time alone.

It can limit your ability to understand what happened or deal with your feelings.  On the other hand, talking about your deployment all the time can be too much for you and others to handle.  Finding a balance between these extremes is the goal.</p>\n        <ul ><li>How do you open up to others and strengthen your social ties?  Things you may want to talk about include:</li>\n        <li>The actual events of your deployment</li>\n        <li>Thoughts and feelings you have about those events</li>\n        <li>Ways you’ve coped with your experiences</li>\n        <li>Ways you’ve grown or changed since your deployment</li>\n        <li>Practical decisions, such as what to do about your job</li>\n        <li>Thoughts about your future</li>\n        <li>Ways you found strength you didn\'t know you had</li>\n        <li>Things you’ve learned that might help others to cope with similar experiences<br /> </li>\n        </ul><p>You should also figure out the best times to talk about what happened.  It’s a good idea to wait to talk about your deployment until:</p>\n        <ul ><li>You’re well rested</li>\n        <li>You’re with someone you know and trust</li>\n        <li>You’ve got enough time to share your thoughts and get feedback</li>\n        <li>You’re not already feeling upset</li>\n        <li>You’ve got some privacy<br /> </li>\n        </ul><p>Other service members worry about getting emotional when talking about deployment.  If that worries you, remember these tips:</p>\n        <ul ><li>It’s ok to get emotional.  Once you share, your emotions won’t seem as overwhelming</li>\n        <li>Tell the person you may get emotional, and you’d appreciate their support if you do.</li>\n        <li>Take a chance.  Talk about painful feelings or thoughts even if it’s hard.</li>\n        <li>Expect some uncomfortable feelings after talking about hard issues.  Know that these feeling are easier to handle with time and practice.</li>\n        <li>Inform the other person you may need to take a break to calm down or collect yourself.</li>\n        </ul><p> </p>\n        <p>When you finish talking:</p>\n        <ul ><li>Thank the person for listening.  They should know you value their time and support.</li>\n        <li>Schedule a cool-down time after talking.  Do something fun and easy to help shift back to the present.</li>\n        <li>Plan to talk about your deployment with someone you trust.  Schedule your plan once a week or once a month.</li>\n        <li>Expect the other person to respond in ways that bother or upset you.  If that happens, know that they probably don’t have bad intentions.  Talk with them about what bothered you, or ask someone else for their opinion.<br type="_moz" /><br /> </li>\n        </ul><p><strong>We strongly encourage you to get help and support from a trained behavioral health professional if you:</strong></p>\n        <ul ><li>Feel extremely sad or depressed for more than a week.</li>\n        <li>Have anxious or distressing thoughts you can’t control for more than a week.</li>\n        <li>Find it difficult to work or meet your daily responsibilities.</li>\n        <li>Experience relationship problems, or have trouble taking care of your family.</li>\n        <li>Increase your use of alcohol or drugs to cope.</li>\n        <li>Overuse of prescription medications.</li>\n        <li>Have traumatic stress reactions that do NOT get better as time passes.</li>\n        <li>Think about hurting or killing yourself.</li>\n        <li>Think about hurting or killing someone else.</li>\n        <li>Feel extremely angry most of the time.</li>\n        <li>Have trouble sleeping most of the time.</li>\n        <li>Have problems eating or lose significant weight without trying.</li>\n        <li>Know others are concerned about you and think you should talk to someone.</li>\n        </ul><p> </p>\n        <p><strong>3.3 Talking to a Professional</strong></p>\n        <p>Many service members find help in talking to a professional, such as a psychologist, counselor, spiritual advisor, doctor, or nurse.

Here are suggestions for talking about your deployment without going into too much detail:</p>\n        <ul><li>“I saw and did some really intense things that are hard for me to talk about.

It’s important to discuss problems in a way that builds up the relationship instead of tearing it down.  Here are some ideas for handling conflicts with a family member:</p>\n        <ul><li><strong>Plan ahead. </strong> Schedule time to discuss the problem.  This gives both of you time to think about what to say.  Find a time when you can talk without distractions.</li>\n        <li><strong>Identify your goal.  </strong>If your goal is to "win" the argument, your relationship will suffer.  Seek an outcome that will satisfy you both.  This usually requires compromises from both partners.</li>\n        <li><strong>"I" Statements.  </strong>When you bring up an issue, don’t blame the other person.  Blame makes people defensive.  Instead, use “I” statements, telling the other person how you feel.</li>\n        </ul><p >Instead of saying, "you never listen to me," say, "I feel frustrated when you read the newspaper while I’m talking."</p>\n        <p >Instead of saying "That\'s ridiculous!" say, "I don\'t understand what you mean. Can you explain it again?"</p>\n        <ul ><li><strong>Stick to one topic.  </strong>Bring up a specific issue that happened.  Tell the other person exactly what happened and why it bothered you.  Focus on resolving the issue, instead of bringing up other things.  Avoid saying "always” or “never”.</li>\n        </ul><p >Instead of saying "You always nag me!" say, "Sometimes I need a few minutes to unwind after work."</p>\n        <ul ><li><strong>Stay calm: </strong>When you get upset, you\'re less likely to think clearly, and you\'re more likely to say things that don\'t help the situation.  Stay calm, and you\'ll be better able to solve the problem.</li>\n        </ul><p >To stay calm, take breaks during the discussion.  Practice relaxing by counting to 10, breathing slowly, or taking a brief walk to relieve tension.</p>\n        <p >Be sure to tell your partner if you need a short break from the conversation so it doesn\'t seem like you\'re walking away.</p>\n        <ul><li><strong>No "below the belt"</strong> <strong>shots</strong>.  Shouting, name-calling, foul language, threats, and sarcasm usually make arguments worse and make it harder to find common ground.</li>\n        </ul><p> </p>\n        <p><strong>1.6 Approaches That Do “More Harm Than Good”</strong></p>\n        <p>Avoid <strong>criticizing</strong> and <strong>lashing out</strong> in anger during arguments.  Trying to control a conversation by demanding that others respond in a certain way won’t get you good results.  Finally, don’t expect others to solve problems for you<strong>.</strong>  You need to help find the solution.</p>\n        <p> </p>\n        <p><strong>1.7 Your Communication Plan</strong></p>\n        <ul><li>Develop a "Communication Plan" to talk about deployment with your family. </li>\n        <li>Decide ahead of time what you want to discuss.</li>\n        <li>Share a little at a time, and then let the other person respond.</li>\n        <li>Learn to endure painful feelings so you don\'t lash out while sharing.</li>\n        <li>Listen without interrupting or getting defensive.</li>\n        <li>Ask for feedback.</li>\n        <li>Ask the other person to share their own feelings, experiences, and ways of coping.</li>\n        <li>Own up to your feelings and behavior – don\'t blame others for how you feel.</li>\n        </ul>\n      '},{id:2,title:"2.0 - Improving Your Relationships",content:"\n        <p>After challenging and potentially life changing experiences like deployment, you may find that you want to spend time alone.

Some people like having a large and mixed social network.  Others prefer a smaller circle of friends.  Either way, it helps to have people you can count on when you need them.  Your social network includes:</p>\n        <ul ><li>Family members and friends</li>\n        <li>Neighbors</li>\n        <li>Co-workers</li>\n        <li>Community members such as members of church or sports league</li>\n        <li>Professionals such as counselors, therapists and doctors</li>\n        </ul><p> </p>\n        <p><strong>2.4 Expanding Your Network</strong></p>\n        <p>Being with others gives you a sense of belonging and security, lifts your spirits, and eases your worries.  Don’t forget, you may be a source of comfort and friendship for others, too! </p>\n        <p>Here are some things you can do to be part of your community and increase your social support network:</p>\n        <ul ><li>Get some exercise.  Join a pick-up game.  Take and exercise class at a local gym or community center. Sports leagues and hiking groups are great ways to meet people while staying fit.

Find local people who share your interest in music, motorcycles, professional sports, cooking, and books</li>\n        <li>Join a place of worship.

Get involved in a Neighborhood Watch group, or a group based on professional interests</li>\n        <li>Volunteer.  Get involved in community service projects—clean up a local park or volunteer at a hospital</li>\n        <li>Join a veteran's organization.  Groups such as the VA, the American Legion, and Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) are safe places to talk and fit in.  You’re probably eligible to join these groups, even if you’re currently active duty</li>\n        <li>Join a cause.  Work with others toward a goal you believe in, such as an election or the protection of a natural area</li>\n        </ul>\n      "},{id:3,title:"3.0 - Talking to Others About Deployment Experiences",content:'\n        <p>Talking about your intense deployment experience can ease the impact of it.

It can limit your ability to understand what happened or deal with your feelings.  On the other hand, talking about your deployment all the time can be too much for you and others to handle.  Finding a balance between these extremes is the goal.</p>\n        <ul ><li>How do you open up to others and strengthen your social ties?  Things you may want to talk about include:</li>\n        <li>The actual events of your deployment</li>\n        <li>Thoughts and feelings you have about those events</li>\n        <li>Ways you’ve coped with your experiences</li>\n        <li>Ways you’ve grown or changed since your deployment</li>\n        <li>Practical decisions, such as what to do about your job</li>\n        <li>Thoughts about your future</li>\n        <li>Ways you found strength you didn\'t know you had</li>\n        <li>Things you’ve learned that might help others to cope with similar experiences<br /> </li>\n        </ul><p>You should also figure out the best times to talk about what happened.  It’s a good idea to wait to talk about your deployment until:</p>\n        <ul ><li>You’re well rested</li>\n        <li>You’re with someone you know and trust</li>\n        <li>You’ve got enough time to share your thoughts and get feedback</li>\n        <li>You’re not already feeling upset</li>\n        <li>You’ve got some privacy<br /> </li>\n        </ul><p>Other service members worry about getting emotional when talking about deployment.  If that worries you, remember these tips:</p>\n        <ul ><li>It’s ok to get emotional.  Once you share, your emotions won’t seem as overwhelming</li>\n        <li>Tell the person you may get emotional, and you’d appreciate their support if you do.</li>\n        <li>Take a chance.  Talk about painful feelings or thoughts even if it’s hard.</li>\n        <li>Expect some uncomfortable feelings after talking about hard issues.
