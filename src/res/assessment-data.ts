        `<p>After a stressful experience, some people turn to drinking to mask painful feelings. But drinking neither solves problems nor fixes painful emotions. In fact, just the opposite: drinking is much more likely to worsen your stress.   Because your level of use suggests that you have become dependent on alcohol, you should not attempt to quit or decrease your alcohol use on your own.  Suddenly discontinuing heavy alcohol use can be dangerous.  Because you're reporting significant alcohol use, we recommend that you seek face-to-face care with a professional.  A medical or mental health provider can evaluate the extent of the problem and develop a plan. Take a copy of your assessment results with you. You can <a href='http://afterdeployment.dcoe.mil/locate-help'>LOCATE</a> tab a provider or a clinic near you by clicking on the <a href='http://afterdeployment.dcoe.mil/locate-help'>LOCATE</a> tab tab in the upper right corner of the main page.

Both the CALL and CHAT options are available 24/7.</p>  <p>Out-of-control drinking can be accompanied by depression, life stress, and even post-traumatic stress, the reaction that many people experience after a major trauma. A good way to determine if you're having problems in these other areas is to take additional assessments. We also suggest that you complete the alcohol and drug assessment again in three months and compare your assessment results with today's results.</p>  <p>We encourage you to check out the materials in AfterDeployment's "Alcohol and Drugs" topic. However, we want to emphasize that your responses  indicate that your best plan is to consult with a health care provider. AfterDeployment is not a substitute for consulting with a provider in person.</p> <p>You can find links to these tools under the RESOURCES tab <a href='http://afterdeployment.dcoe.mil/locate-help'>LOCATE</a> tabd above.</p><p> You may find it helpful to join the <a href='https://www.facebook.com/afterdeployment/timeline'>AfterDeployment Facebook</a> page where you can network with others on a range of topics. </p>`

Both the CALL and CHAT options are available 24-7.</p><p>Another way to explore these experiences is to check out the materials in AfterDeployment’s “Life Stress” topic. The stress of being a caregiver can be accompanied by problems in other areas of life. You can determine where other problems may exist or the extent of the problem by taking additional assessments. </p><p>You can find links to these tools under the RESOURCES tab located above.</p><p> You may find it helpful to join the <a href='https://www.facebook.com/afterdeployment/timeline'>AfterDeployment Facebook</a> page where you can network with others on a range of topics. </p>`

        `<p>Your score suggests that you are feeling a high level of tension based on doubts about beliefs  about your spirituality which may have previously helped you to cope with difficulties in life.   This might be because you have experienced significant trauma and have been unable to reconcile that experience with your beliefs.  Many people find themselves questioning long held beliefs in response to trauma, illness, or disappointments.  However,   research suggests that high levels of spiritual struggle, even in the short term, can lead to a great deal of distress, significantly impacting health and well-being.  The longer the tension remains unresolved, the greater the likelihood of serious physical and emotional problems.  Because of the potential impact of your current level of spiritual struggle on your health and well-being, we strongly suggest that you work to resolve the tension you are experiencing.

        `<p>Your score is in a range typically associated with a moderate level of spiritual struggle.</p>  <p>You describe yourself as someone who is experiencing  a moderate degree of spiritual struggle in response to the stress in your life. </p>`,
        `<p>Your score suggests that for the most part, you believe you can count on your spiritual beliefs for support during difficult times.  However, you have qualified your confidence in your ability to rely completely on the meaning you find in spirituality.  It is not at all uncommon for trauma, distress, or disappointment to create doubts about some aspects of one’s spiritual beliefs.    If the resulting spiritual struggle is temporary it is likely to have little effect on either your well-being or resilience.  However, even moderate amounts of unresolved, chronic spiritual tension, in the form of anger, resentment or a sense of abandonment, significantly increase the likelihood of physical and emotional problems.
