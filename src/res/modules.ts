      It's common for service members to use alcohol. However, excessive drinking can cause problems in relationships, trouble fulfilling duties because of intoxication, and financial and legal difficulties. In a survey conducted between 2004 and 2006, twenty-one percent of service members admitted to drinking heavily, and another seven percent of veterans reported a substance abuse problem in the year prior to the survey.

    content: `<p>Might sound funny to say it, but in some ways deployment is easy. During deployment, rules are clear and goals well defined. 
      Missions are exact, and orders obeyed. Your role, rank, and responsibilities are "second nature" and all you've got to think about is getting the job done, protecting others, and staying alive. 
      But back home, everything's less clearly defined. Rules and ranks may be loose and confusing. Non-military, civilian workplaces may be less structured, and stakes are generally lower. Your responsibilities and goals may seem less critical, and everything might seem uncertain or pointless. Adjusting to this "new" world may be quite a challenge.

    content: `<p>Anxiety comes in many forms. Some people experience anxiety only in specific situations, like when they're asked to speak in public or when they need to fly on an airplane. Others worry a lot, and find themselves feeling anxious on and off throughout the day – and some suffer panic attacks, sudden feelings of anxiety that come on unpredictably. Anxiety is the most common behavioral health problem in the United States, affecting 40 million adults (18.1% of the population aged 18 and older).</p>

    content: `<p>Depression can take many forms. Some people with depression lose all interest in socializing. Others isolate themselves from spouses, loved ones, friends, and coworkers. Depression can make it hard for you to sleep, or it can cause you to sleep too much. It can cause physical problems like headaches, stomach upsets, weight loss or weight gain, and chronic pain. It can cause you to feel jittery and agitated – or it can cause you to lose all your energy. Maybe worst of all, it can make it hard for you to reach out for help because you feel worthless or hopeless – and in extreme cases it can lead to thoughts of suicide. Studies have found that many active duty Soldiers and Marines were more depressed after deployment than before.</p>

    Feelings of anger can range from minor irritation to intense rage. You may become angry when you're feeling threatened or when someone does something that feels wrong or hurtful. If your anger is too intense or frequent, or if you express your anger aggressively, it can become a problem. Intense anger and aggression can hurt your relationships and your work. It can cause others to retaliate, and it may also contribute to feelings of guilt, shame, and regret.

    It's normal to sleep poorly on occasion, especially in reaction to stress. But people who don't sleep well are more likely to be depressed, irritable or anxious – and poor sleep can contribute to problems with attention, concentration, and memory. If you're having trouble sleeping, your job performance, family life, and relationships can suffer, and you're at increased risk for accidents.
